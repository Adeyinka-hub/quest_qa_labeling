0,39,Will leaving corpses lying around upset my prisoners?,"I see questions/information online about how to get rid of corpses but I'm not sure what the consequences to having them lying around are.

I know that I can use a morgue to store them and that they will eventually be taken away in a hearse. However, I've always just left them lying around. This doesn't seem to have any obvious consequences.

Do they upset prisoners or staff (e.g. increasing the danger level beyond what death normally does)? Make them sick? Slow down pathing? Is this something that's not implemented yet or is leaving dead bodies all over the place meant to be completely fine?

The wiki's pages for Death and Morgue don't shed any light on this. All I'm finding is the how of getting rid of corpses/glitches related to it but not why it matters in the first place. All I've seen that's related is that apparently prisoners can loot guard corpses for keys, but there's no obvious consequences for prisoner corpses which are what I tend to end up with.

So why not just leave them in the corridors?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
",Anu,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/72927,"I think it is possible with custom fields.

Add a custom fields, for example, named link. Put the link into the value field. Then you will be able to access it something like that:

&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'link', true ); ?&gt;""&gt;
    &lt;?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?&gt;

2,70,"Is accuracy, recoil or bullet spread affected by enemy hits?","To experiment I started a bot game, toggled invincibility and let the bots attack me. There were two clear hit effects: a major one that tilts view up a lot and sideways and a minor one that only tilts it up.

So I tried releasing single shots exactly at the tilts: during a major one a single bullet ended up here (slightly covered by text). Actually the crosshair never moves that high so there tends to be a good amount of additional upward deviation of single shots fired.

But when single-shooting during the minor tilts the marks seemed to end up exactly at the location of the crosshair.

Now, when switching to spraying while being shot this pattern emerged. This was mostly caused by the minor tilts and, I guess, ""standard recoil"". Occasionally a major tilt caused a single bullet to lie severly outside of the depicted cone.

3,132,Suddenly got an I/O error from my external HDD,"I have used my Raspberry Pi as a torrent-server for quite a while now. My Western Digital ""My Passport-Ultra"" external HDD and Transmission running on RPi has worked flawlessly for more than a year. Suddenly last week my setup started producing I/O errors and now when I SSH into my RPi I cant find the HDD folder. 

I have not changed anything with my RPi or the torrent-server setup since I set it up.

Can someone help me find a solution to my problem?

EDIT:

The external HHD works fine the first 20 minutes or so, and then Transmisson gives me ""Error: Input/output error"".

I recommend that you copy all of your data off of this drive to another hard drive before it fails completely. 

It is possible that it could be the USB connection on the Pi instead of the drive.  Does the drive behave like this on a different computer system?

Again, I strongly recommend that you backup any irreplaceable data on this drive before it fails completely.  If you have another USB drive I recommend using rsync.  I use the following command to backup one external hard drive to a 2nd device on my Pi where /media/USBHDD1 is the mount point of the 1st drive and /media/USBHDD2 is the mount point of the 2nd drive.  rsync can recover from an interrupted copy in case your drive disappears while performing the copy.  You should be able to just power cycle failed drive and perform the copy command again.  rsync should pick up where it left off.

rsync -av --delete /media/USBHDD1/* /media/USBHDD2/

6,257,Configure which plugin custom post types get registered,"I am writing a plugin that creates custom post types, but i want users to be able to turn them on and off via a filter in the functions.php file.

How can I allow users to provide an array using a filter or action that will control which post types register_post_type gets called?

  The issue i'm having is that custom post types register_post_type has
  to be called during init and functions.php is read far after this.


That's not true. functions.php is read before init because you can declare your functions in there and then hook them to init.

Since you want to avoid a settings page and you want your users to modify the code (at your own risk), you could use some flags:

add_action('init', 'wpse_109719_post_types');

function wpse_109719_post_types(){

  $post_type1 = true;
  $post_type2 = true;
  $post_type3 = false; // your users don't want this one

  if( $post_type1 ){
    register_post_type( 'your_post_type_1', $args );
  }

  if( $post_type2 ){
    register_post_type( 'your_post_type_2', $args );
  }

  if( $post_type3 ){
    // won't be registered since $post_type3 was declared as false
    register_post_type( 'your_post_type_3', $args );
  }

}



Not tested, but you can use something like that to collect the post types:

$val = array ();
$options_array = apply_filters( 'my_unique_filter', $val );
print_r( $options_array );
// make a loop and register_post_type here. don't forget to hook at init


In your plugins:

function filter1( $val ){
  $val[] = 'post_type1';
  return $val;
}

function filter2( $val ){
  $val[] = 'post_type2';
  return $val;
}

function filter3( $val ){
  $val[] = 'post_type3';
  return $val;
}


add_filter('my_unique_filter', 'filter1');
add_filter('my_unique_filter', 'filter2');
add_filter('my_unique_filter', 'filter3');

7,267,"Why say ""it rhymes with Grape""?","There is a scene in 21 Jumpstreet where Dave Franco' character Eric says ""do you know what they'll do to me in prison it rhymes with grape"" and it made me curious as to why it was phrased that way. 

In Knocked Up a similar joke was made ""it rhymes with smabortion"" which I believe I read was done due to censors. However the repeating setup for the joke has me curious if this time it was due to censors or if it was just considered a funny setup that bared repeating. So was it censoring or continuing a joke?
",Kevin Howell,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/645,"Opinion: It was a funny(?) joke.

Although a similar setup was used in Knocked Up, the truth is similar setups have been used in plenty of comedy movies.

Whilst I understand your query regarding the censors, it seems difficult to imagine why censorship would be an issue, the main reason I can think of being:


There is a colossal amount of crass language, violence, partial nudity and drug taking in the film. Why would all this be considered acceptable but a line about rape wouldn't be?


It seems more likely to me that it was a funny line that works in the context of the scene as it seems so abhorrent that he can't bring himself to utter the actual word, instead resorting to childish rhyming (suggesting the mere thought of it makes him regress to his inner child in fear). 

Whether it was a homage to his (extremely popular) line from Knocked Up is something I can find no reference to online, but solely in my own opinion, I can't see how this was a censorship issue.

12,322,How to add custom fields to menu items,"I've been looking at using menu attributes module for Drupal 7 to add an extra field to the menu navigation system. However this adds a new attribute to the attribute array and thus prints it out in the anchor link.

  function themename_menu_link(array $variables) {
  $element = $variables['element'];
  $sub_menu = '';

  if ($element['#below'])
  {
    $sub_menu = drupal_render($element['#below']);
  }

  $element['#localized_options']['html'] = TRUE;

  $subtitle = $element['#localized_options']['attributes']['subtitle']; //get sub text

  $linktext = $element['#title']. '&lt;span&gt;'. $subtitle .'&lt;/span&gt;';

  return '&lt;li' . drupal_attributes($element['#attributes']) . '&gt;' . $output . $sub_menu . ""&lt;/li&gt;\n"";

&lt;a subtitle=""subtitleexampletext"" href=""/node/13""&gt;About us&lt;span&gt;subtitleexampletext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


is there anyway to hide the attribute in the link and just spit it out where ever I want it in the html? Or is there a better way of doing this? I've looked at power menu module as well, but thats not quite what I'm after either.

TIA
",Jared,https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/10963,"You can use hook_form_alter to alter the menu link edit form. 
This way you can add a extra field to the form, in your case:

$form['subtitle'] = array(
 '#type'=&gt;'textfield',
 '#title'=&gt; t('Subtitle'),
);


Then add an extra submit hanlder to the form:

$form['#submit'][] = '_my_submit_handler';


In your submit handler you can access your custom value by using $form_state['values']['subtitle'].

You will have to store this value in an extra sql table or a variable_set,together with the menu-item ID.

Once you have done that, in your theme function you can access your subtitle by menu id.
Or you can use  MYTHEME_preprocess_menu_link to add extra info to $variables, which you then can access in your theme function.

Hopes this helpes you out.

15,340,A BrainF*ck-ish compiler in C,"-ish because I removed the input functionality from the compiler. And, the compiler does not support nested loops

I've been recently reading up on compilers and how they work.

Although this doesn't use most of the things I've learned about (the lexical and parser things), I thought it would be fun to try create a brainf*ck compiler, rather than an interpreter.

Code

bfc.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static int i;
static char *code; // these two as static so get_amt_to_change can easily interact

int get_amt_to_change(char c); // so the compiler doesn't write (ie) add di, 1 ten times

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    code = argv[1];
    puts(""xor di, di\n""
         ""setup_loop:\n""
         ""mov byte [tape + di], 0\n""
         ""add di, 1\n""
         ""cmp di, 101\n""
         ""jne setup_loop\n""
         ""xor di, di""); // sets up the tape with all 0's
    int loop_count = 0; // to keep track of asm subroutines for [ and ]
    for(i = 0; code[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        switch(code[i]) {
            case '+':
                printf(""add byte [tape + di], %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('+'));
                break;
            case '-':
                printf(""sub byte [tape + di], %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('-'));
                break;
            case '&gt;':
                printf(""add di, %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('&gt;'));
                break;
            case '&lt;':
                printf(""sub di, %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('&lt;'));

Questions


My C code only has one subroutine. Are there any other logical ones to add?
I did a lot of optimizing on the assembly code output. Could it be further optimized?

You can optimize the setup code by iterating backwards. It shaves off 2 instructions! It too will leave DI=0.

16,357,The Riemann Integrability of a function similar to Dirichlet's function,"$\textbf{Problem:}$ Consider the function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by letting $f(x)=0$ for rational $x$ and $f(x)=x$ for irrational $x$. Calculate the upper and lower Riemann integrals of $f$. Is $f$ Riemann integrable?  

$\textbf{	Solution Attempt:}$ Let $P_n=\{0=t_0,...,t_n=1\}$ be a partition of $[0,1]$, where $t_k = \frac{k}{n}$. For this partition, we have $$U(f,P_n)=\sum^{n}_{k=1} t_k (t_k - t_{k-1}) = \sum^{n}_{k=1} t_k (\frac{k}{n} - \frac{k-1}{n})=\sum^{n}_{k=1} \frac{k}{n} (\frac{1}{n})= \frac{1}{n^2} \sum^{n}_{k=1} k.$$ A familiar property of the natural numbers gives us that $\sum^{n}_{k=1} k= \frac{1}{2}n(n+1).$ Thus, $U(f,P)= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2n}.$ Recall, the upper Riemann integral $U(f)$ is defined as $U(f)=\inf
\{U(f,P)\}$, where $P$ is a parition of $[0,1].$ As $n \rightarrow \infty$, $P_n \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}.$ [Note: this is where I am a little unsure of myself.] Thus, $U(f)=\frac{1}{2}$. However, the lower Riemann integral is $0$. Hence, the upper and lower Riemann integrals disagree. We conclude that $f$ is not Riemann integrable. $\blacksquare$

If the aforementioned function was changed so that it took on the value of $0$ for irrational $x$ and $x$ for rational $x$, then $f$ would be zero almost-everywhere. Hence, it would be Lebesgue integrable. Is this correct? I am quite unsure of the Lebesgue integrability for the original function. A hint would great! Thank you!

26,542,Surfaces ruled over elliptic curves,"Ground field $\Bbb{C}$. Algebraic category. Elliptic surfaces are those surfaces endowed with a morphism onto some smooth curve, with generic fiber an elliptic curve.

Suppose $E$ is an elliptic curve and consider the ruled surface
$$ S=\frac{E\times\Bbb{P}^1}{G} $$
where $G$ is a group of translations of $E$, acting on $\Bbb{P}^1$. Then $S$ is an elliptic surface, for the projection on the second factor induces a morphism $S\rightarrow\Bbb{P}^1$ whose fibers are elliptic curves ($F=E/G$, in fact).

Now, let $p\colon S\rightarrow C$ be an elliptic surface and suppose $S$ is ruled over an elliptic curve $E$. 

Is $S$ isomorphic to the above example? Any hint for attacking this? Thank you.
",Heitor,https://mathoverflow.net/users/34136,"EDIT We show that the answer to the OP's question is yes. Thanks to Will Sawin for his comments.

I use the notation of [Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry, Chapter V Section 2].

Since $S$ is a ruled surface, there exists a section $C_0$ of minimal self-intersection; set $C_0^2 = -e$. If we write $S=\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, with $\mathcal{E}$ normalized, then $e= - \deg \mathcal{E}$.

Moreover, since the base of the ruling is an elliptic curve $E$, then $e \in \{-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}$.

We can exclude the case $e &gt;0$. Indeed, any divisor $D \in \textrm{Pic}(S)$ can be written as $a C_0 + b f$, where $f$ is the fibre of the ruling. Now the elliptic fibre of the morphism over $\mathbb{P}^1$ must satisfy  $(aC_0+bf)^2=0$, that is $b = \frac{1}{2}ae$. But if $e &gt;0$ then an effective divisor must also satisfy $b \geq ae$ (Hartshorne, Proposition 2.20 p. 382) and this is a contradiction.

Then the only possibility is $e \in \{-1, 0 \}$.

The case $e=-1$ corresponds to the second symmetric product $\textrm{Sym}^2(E)$; in this case $\mathcal{E}$ is the unique indecomposable rank two vector bundle on $E$ with $\deg \mathcal{E} =1$. Then the linear system $|4C_0-2f|$ is a pencil of elliptic curves. One can also write $S$ in the desired for (see Wil Sawin's first comment). 

The case $\mathcal{E}=0$ corresponds either to the trivial bundle (so $S$ is a product), or to $\mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L}$, with $\deg \mathcal{L}=0$ or to $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is the unique indecomposible rank two vector bundle on $E$ such that $\deg \mathcal{E}=0$.

Let us consider first the case $\mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L}$, with $\deg \mathcal{L}=0$. Then the curves in the elliptic pencil should correspond to elements of $h^0(aC_0)$, that is to sections of $\textrm{Sym}^a (\mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L})$. Since we must have two independent sections, we obtain that  $\mathcal{L}$ is a torsion bundle. In this case the elliptic fibration do exist, and one can easily write $S$ in the desired form (see Will Sawin's second comment).

Finally, let us exclude the case $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, with $\mathcal{E}$ indecomposable of degree $0$. Again, the curves in the elliptic pencil must correspond to elements of $h^0(aC_0)$, that is to sections of $\textrm{Sym}^a \mathcal{E}$. But from [Atiyah, Vector bundles on an elliptic curve, Theorem 9] one sees that $\textrm{Sym}^a  \mathcal{E}$ is again indecomposable of degree $0$, and that $h^0(\textrm{Sym}^a \mathcal{E})=1$. Thus one does not have two independent sections, and the elliptic pencil cannot exist.

Summing up, we obtain


  Let $p \colon S \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be an elliptic surface and assume that $S$ is ruled over an elliptic curve $E$. Then $S=\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, where either 
  
  $\bullet$ $\mathcal{E}$ is the unique indecomposable rank $2$ vector bundle of degree $1$ on $E$, or
  
  $\bullet$ $\mathcal{E}= \mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a (possibly trivial) torsion line bundle. 
  
  In both cases, we can also write $S$ in the desired form $S=(E \times \mathbb{P}^1)/G$.

Can the problem have something to do with windows 7, some background or system process, or so? Should I install any extention or plugin in order to run network analysis programs on win 7?

28,589,Bash filename tab completion,"I have noticed sometimes that tab completion is helpfully filtered in bash. I am a java programmer and often use the java and javac commands in the terminal for quick or remote tasks.

Say I have the two usual files in a directory: MyProgram.java and MyProgram.class

If I ask bash to tabcomplete from the command prefix java M, it fills straight out to java MyProgram, this is helpful. Clearly either bash is configured to only accept *.class completions for the java command (and knows to strip the file extension), or the java command is telling bash this somehow.

I would like to accomplish the same with a text editor, so I could type in nano M and have it tab complete to nano MyProgram.java rather than pausing at nano MyProgram., is it possible to say, blacklist *.class from nano's tab complete?

Most of all I'd just be interested to know if this is a bash configuration or something program-side.
",lynks,https://superuser.com/users/155196,"java has a separate auto-completion script that overrides the default completion mechanism. On my distribution (Arch Linux), it is installed in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/java.

To override the behaviour of tab-completion, you could create such a script. If you just want to have all .class files ignored for every command, you could set the FIGNORE variable (e.g. in your ~/.bashrc). Example: FIGNORE=.class. From the manual page of bash:


  FIGNORE
  A  colon-separated  list  of  suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see READLINE below).  A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in FIGNORE is excluded from the list of matched filenames.  A sample value is "".o:~"".

Ovbiously I'm making the assumption that your $page_template variable doesn't have .php on the end, but you can ammend that as required.

While most well-known Lie groups are matrix groups, there do in fact exist Lie groups which are not matrix groups. That is, they have no faithful finite dimensional representations.

$$H=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; a &amp; b\newline 0&amp;1&amp;c\newline 0 &amp;0 &amp;1\end{pmatrix}\mid a,b,c\in\mathbb{R} \},$$

$$\Gamma=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; n\newline0&amp;1&amp;0\newline 0 &amp;0 &amp;1\end{pmatrix}\mid n\in\mathbb{Z}\}.$$

The subgroup $\Gamma$ is central, and thus normal. The Lie group $H/\Gamma$ has no faithful finite dimensional representations over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

First look at the picture:



Since Madara came, he was using only Sharingan, and this can be seen until 07:43 in the picture, while he was dodging Gaara's sand attacks. However, when Naruto was above him with an Odama Rasengan, Madara suddenly could be seen with the Rinnegan on his eyes (07:45), and nobody noticed it like if it was a mistake. It should have been normal Sharingan.

Then, at 08:17, Madara was using the Mangekyou Sharingan, since he activated it after Naruto's attack to invoke the Susanoo.

And after that, at around 10:04, Madara was targeted by a Rasenshuriken, hence he had to activate the Rinnegan, and that was at 10:06. It was the first time that he did it since he came to life with Edo Tensei, and that could be confirmed from everybody's reaction when they saw his Rinnegan at around 10:56 (""Why does he have the Rinnegan?"").

Among them was a picture of the never-before-identified victim, with the note ""His name was Arnold"".

My question is: who sent that box, and why then?

My best guess is that it was somehow related to that boy's mother's death (who happened to have ""died recently"", as sister Vivian said), but I fail to see how. Is there some hint to the answer that I've missed? They usually explain that kind of stuff.
",Vedran Šego,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/5589,"We don't know, but probably someone under the instructions of Sister Grace.

We do know from the episode that the body was discovered by a man called Walter Rafferty. Every year, he revisited the spot where he found the body. We also find out that he's not the only visitor. Every year, a woman in a green coat brings a rose to the location.

As the episode progresses, we learn that this woman is Sister Grace. We also learn that Sister Grace is the mother of Arnold (the boy in the box), conceived with a man called Clayton. Arnold instinctively seemed to know this, as he wanted to remain with the sisters as opposed to getting adopted.

Despite this, Sister Grace is eager for him to move on. She is concerned about his behaviour and basically convinces Clayton to give him one of the treatments being done in his work. These treatments are radiation related and should not be used on Arnold. Sister Grace, however, is hopeful they will work. Alas, they do not - Arnold dies soon after and the Sisters put the body in the box.

So we know this then:


Sister Grace was really Arnold's mother.   
Sister Grace desperately wanted Arnold to be adopted, inadvertantly causing his death through the radiation treatment.   
Sister Grace visited the place his body was found every year.


This strongly suggests that the suitcase given to the police, shortly after her death, notifying them about the case, was related to her. Whether her will stipulated it be delivered, or a friend did it, we don't know. It just seems very likely she is the root cause of it.

Ultimately though, the mystery works in this episode. The Boy in the Box is based on a real life, unsolved murder. Whilst they effectively discover what happened in this episode, who alerted them remains a mystery. This ties in well with the fact that the case's real life counterpart is unsolved and thus a mystery as well.

37,765,"Why is ""in the name of Jesus Christ"" usually used at the end?","In the scriptures, a phrase such as ""in the name of the Lord"" or ""in the name of Jesus"" is typically used at the beginning of statements, especially commands. In our day, I notice that most of our prayers, for instance, end ""in Jesus' name"" or ""in the name of Jesus Christ."" By way of another example, it seems that even most special Priesthood blessings by Latter-day Saints end with such a phrase, instead of starting with it.

Is there significance in the reversal of the placement of this phrase? Does the meaning change whether at the beginning or end?

(Sometimes I think when we say a prayer and end it with that phrase, it tends to get lost behind the other words, or is said quickly as a part of just ending the prayer, instead of carrying the meaning of praying in the Lord's name, which is why I'm asking this question.)
",Matt,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1003,"The answer to your question is in several Scriptures. 

In the book of Matthew He told us first of all that we should pray directly to the Father, and not for rewards here on Earth.

Matthew 6:5 through 7 KJV


  5  And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
  
  6  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 
  
  7  But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.


Then Jesus taught his disciples (which of course includes us) in the model prayer:

Matthew 6:9 through 15 KJV


  9  After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. 
  
  10  Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
  
  11  Give us this day our daily bread. 
  
  12  And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 
  
  13  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
  
  14  For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: 
  
  15  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.


This was given as an outline and not meant to be recited word for word, but even if you recite it word for word, what matters is your intent; and so praying the ""Lord's Prayer"" in not in any way sacrilegious as long as your intent is right.

He went on to say that we need to pray knowing that God has the power to grant our every wish, and that He will grant them in accordance with His plans for us.

Matthew 21:22  KJV


  And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. 


John 14:13 and 14 KJV


  13  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
  
  14  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.


Finally He tells us that if we expect him to grant our request we must continue in his word, and be the best Christian we know how to be.

John 15:7  KJV

38,811,Why do Apple bloggers use Skype or Google Hangouts instead of iChat for video podcasts?,"I enjoy a few ""talking heads"" type of video podcasts by Apple bloggers. How come they don't use iChat? Doesn't iChat have group video conferencing or are there technical (as opposed to social) reasons to prefer skype over iChat for producing a video podcast?
",thanks_in_advance,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/60784,"
Awareness

Many people know what Skype is — not many know about iChat in comparison. As soon as someone says 'video conference' the immediate response by many is 'Skype!'
Familiarity

Many of the older video podcasts use Skype because that's what they started with. Familiarity is very important with people that make video podcasts for a living. They see no reason to switch because Skype works well for them.
Plugins

There are a number of plugins made for Skype for recording the call, etc. This means that for those that use Skype they'd have no reason to switch to iChat since their favourite plugin isn't available that works with the rest of their equipment.
Livestreaming

Many video podcasts use Google Hangouts because of its ease of use for livestreaming it as well. Google Hangouts can be livestreamed with practically no preparation or equipment and then immediately made available on YouTube after, which is perfect for many.
Number of People

Google Hangouts can hold many more people than iChat/Skype, which makes it perfect for large events.

And I'm pretty sure that I should use makefile for such case
",iMisanthrope,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3414386,"You are confusing object files with static libraries. An object file
is not a static library and the gfortran linker - which is simply
the GNU system linker, invoked by gfortran - will not treat it as such.
You need a static library and you are trying to use object files in lieu. 

The linker recognizes an object file by the extension .o. It recognizes
a static library by the extension .a, and it expects the contents of an .a file
to have the form of a static library, not the format of an object file. (So you
cannot make an object file into a static library just by renaming it).

The linker will link into your program every object file that appears on its
commandline, whether or not it is needed. It does not expect you to mention
object files if you don't want them linked. The linker options -L and -l for
locating libraries have no application to object files.

A static library is a fairly simple archive containing some number of
object files, plus a house-keeping header and typically an index of the
public symbols defined in the contained object files.

When the linker encounters a static library on its commandline, it does not
link the entire contents of the library (unless you expressly tell it to). It inspects
the contained object files to determine which, if any, of them contain
definitions for symbols that are as yet undefined at that point in the linkage
of the program. If any object file in the library is found to provide any
of the missing definitions, then that object file is extracted from the library
and linked into the program. Object files in the library that provide no
missing definitions are not linked. Libraries on the commandline are sequentially
inspected in this way until either all the symbols referred to by the program 
have definitions in linked object files or there are no more libraries.

If as you say the object files that you are trying to use as libraries are stable
resources that you never have to build for your projects, then you can just make a static
library out of them and link that library with your per-project programs.

To make a static library from object files, use the ar tool. 
See man ar.

When you have made your library, say, libsubs.a, and have decided it shall reside
in some directory, /path/to/subs, then you link it with a program by adding

    -L/path/to/subs -lsubs


to the commandline in which your program is linked. This will cause the linker
to search for a library called libsubs.a in directory /path/to/subs.

So if you are compiling and linking in a single step, use it like:

gfortran -o myprog myprog.f90 -L/path/to/subs -lsubs


And if you are compiling and linking in distinct steps, use it like:

gfortran -c -o myprog_1st_file.o myprog_1st_file.f90
gfortran -c -o myprog_2nd_file.o myprog_2nd_file.f90
gfortran -o myprog myprog_1st_file.o myprog_2nd_file.o -L/path/to/subs -lsubs


This is how you are supposed to use a set of object file resources of which
different subsets will be required for linkage with different programs: you put
them in a library and link the library.

  (1) The man from whom I got the pen.
  
  (2) The man from I got the pen.
  
  (3) The man I got the pen from.
  
  (4) The man who(m) I got the pen from.  


Let's start with example (4) because it's the easiest to talk about:


(4) .... the man(i) [whom (i)  I got the pen from ___ (i) ]


The man here is the antecedent for the word who(m).  There is a gap at the end of the clause that represents a missing word after the preposition from. All three parts have the same index, they all refer to the same person. We could represent the relative clause like this:


the man [whom I got the pen from him  ].


Here, the object of the preposition is the word who(m), but whom is at the beginning of the clause. The proposition from has been 'stranded' at the end of the sentence.

If we want to, we can put the whole preposition phrase at the beginning of the clause. This is what happens in example (1):


(1)  ... the man [from whom I got the pen ___ ]. 


If we arrange the sentence like this, the preposition occurs in the normal position before its object whom. We can think about the clause like this:


... the man [from whom I got the pen from him ]. 


Notice that we can only move the preposition so that it comes before its object. Otherwise it must stay in its normal position. In these relative clauses, I is the subject of the clause. Because the relative word who(m) is not the subject, we can drop it. We don't need to use a relative word at all:


(3) ... the man(i) [I got the pen from ____(i) ].


There is still a gap at the end of the sentence, where the object of from is missing. But there is no relative pronoun whom in this sentence. Notice that from must be at the end of the clause in its normal position. We cannot move it so that it comes before its object. This is because the object of the word from is missing! From here occurs before the gap where its object would be. We could represent the clause like this:


(3) ... the man [I got the pen from  him  ].


If we try to move from to  a different position, the clause will be ungrammatical:


(2) *... the man(i) [from I got the pen ___(i) ] (wrong).


Here the word from doesn't appear before its real object - or the gap left from the missing object. If we try to reconstruct the missing parts we have the following representation:


(2) *... the man [from I got the pen him ] (wrong).


This is definitely not a good clause!

Hope this is helpful.

43,905,Extend Wordpress (4.x) session and nonce,"We've got a small web application that allows users to log in (via WordPress) and remain logged in for a max 15 min session for security purposes. Because most sessions will last longer, I have a small ajax call that's made on each click of the html document itself. 

The ajax call itself fires to the /admin-ajax.php file, and it hits a function (in functions.php). Below is that function: 

function extend_my_session_yo(){
    $user_id = get_current_user_id();
    wp_set_auth_cookie($user_id, false, true);

    $new_logout = wp_logout_url();

    if ( is_user_logged_in() ) {
        echo 'session extended 15 mins ' . $new_logout;
    } 
    // if a user is *not* logged in, Wordpress just outputs a ""0"". 
    die();
}


The wp_set_auth_cookie() does the hard work. It correctly allows for (on each click) an extended 15 mins session. The problem is if someone tries to logout. The current logout link is echo'd via wp_logout_url(), but that logout url has a nonce from the moment it's created by WordPress. 

So in the function above, I'm generating a new logout url (and from the WP core code it seems that this is generated by getting the session token from the new cookie), but each click of the new logout url gives the Wordpress Failure Notice page indicating a nonce mismatch. I've even gone so far to copy code from pluggable.php (for wp_verify_nonce()) for checking the hash_equals() function for $expected vs $nonce and they're equal. Yet I still get nonce errors. 

Does anyone know how to set a new auth/logged_in cookie while also setting a new nonce to avoid these errors? 
",Focus97,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/68206,"Your problem is that you call wp_logout_url immediately after wp_set_auth_cookie. 

wp_set_auth_cookie() does some setcookie() calls. Unfortunately setcookie doesn't make the new value available instantly in the PHP global $_COOKIE. It must be set through a new HTTP Request first.

wp_logout_url() (via wp_nonce_url > wp_create_nonce > wp_get_session_token > wp_parse_auth_cookie) fetches $_COOKIE[LOGGED_IN_COOKIE] in order to create a valid nonce, not knowing that the logged in cookie has already been updated. (I'm not quite sure if we may call this a WP core bug.)

There is an action hook in wp_set_auth_cookie named set_logged_in_cookie, which should allow you to update the session cookie value during your ajax request. 

function my_update_cookie( $logged_in_cookie ){
    $_COOKIE[LOGGED_IN_COOKIE] = $logged_in_cookie;

I am curious of any concerns or issues regarding having a washer and dryer inside a walk in closet. Mainly, in terms of moisture. Does the washer or dryer product enough moisture in the room that we would need to include a vent? Also, does the drywall in the room need to be the same that is used in bathrooms?

Update: Clarification. 
By vent, I mean a separate vent other than the dryer vent. Something like a bathroom ceiling vent in addition to the dryer exhaust vent.

All-in-one washer/dryer combo units don't need an air vent, but need a water drain to remove the water from the drying stage (which you need anyways to drain the wash cycle). 

The walls are irrelevant. So don't worry about those.

The bigger concern would be the floor. If this is a high efficiency front-loading washer, it will be prone to lots of lateral shaking. Most wood framed floors are ill equipped to handle the speed of front loader washers. It's usually recommended that they be placed on concrete slabs. 

As such if the closet wasn't designed for a washer/dryer, then you probably need to beef up the floor as much as you can to reduce the shaking.

48,1082,PCB's and designing power connections,"I've designed a few PCB's now, but never put much thought into good practices. They were small boards and most of the emphasis was put into just making sure everything that needed to be connected was connected.

Now I want to get more serious into making well designed boards. I've designed and redesigned my current project multiple times trying to come up with a good looking layout. 

This project is based around the ATXMega256 mCU running on a 16Mhz crystal, around 60 total components and 7 or 8 of them being IC's.

For my next redesign, I plan on giving ""Manhattan Routing"" a go to at least try and help with crazy traces going every which way - but that's a little bit off topic.

The problem I seem to run into the most is understanding an appropriate method of running power to each IC. Normally, I would just daisy chain them but that is said to be a bad practice.

Here are my questions relating to feeding power


I've heard of the ""Star Configuration"" where all the IC's tie directly into the regulator but haven't seen a real life example of that so I'm not sure how to design that into my projects. It sounds like a mess of traces coming off of one pad in my mind. Can you post an example of a well designed Star Configuration?
What would be some advantages and disadvantages of using the star configuration as opposed to a power plane, other than the obvious of power being everywhere with a plane.
When is it ok or not ok to use a plane for VCC, specifically for a 2 layer board as I've heard that it's not as common on a 2 layer board?
If I shouldn't use a power plane, which is better in the case of traces needing to cross each other: using via's for GPIO or via's for power?
If it is ok to use a power plane on a 2 layer board, should VCC be on the top layer or bottom, obviously I would have a Ground plane as well.


I know there isn't a win/win answer to these questions because every project is going to be different and require different planning, but I think the basic concept behind it should be somewhat universal that people follow. You have to know the rules before you can break them.

I also realize that these questions may be beyond the scope of online discussion, but I'm looking for more general answers that can help push me in the right direction.
