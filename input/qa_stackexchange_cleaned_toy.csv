",hroncok,"You could experiment with slicing. For example, you might not need high resolution all over the object, but you can speed up some straight parts by using greater layer high there. See a part of Slic3r manual about such thing.

It is also possible to print thicker infill every Nth layer, see Infill optimization in Slic3r.

Other slicers might have those features as well.

",plaintoothpaste,"For FDM technologies in general with a single extruder, slicing modifications is your only options. However there will be a trade off between quality and speed. 
For ABS, changing to a machine with a enclosed build (such as a zortrax) chamber may help and a heated build chamber (Stratasys machine) will help the quality and reliability but not the print speed directly. As ABS has a tendency to warp vase mode is not the best idea either.

If you only need high resolution and not strength then reducing the infill percentage or even using vase mode will speed up the print. Also changing to a material that you can print at higher speeds like PLA will magnify any of the previous settings.

If you have two extruders then changing to a wider nozzle and using that for infill may speed up the print, heating and cooling time during extruder changeover may actually make it slower.

For other technologies there are lots of options digital light projection (DLP) and stereolithography (SLA) both provide significantly higher resolution then FDM, with DLP being the faster of the two, comparison. Take the review with a grain of salt though as the technologies are far from standardised, for example out DLP at work offers far higher resolution and speed then our SLA which is quite old.

Sintering or melting technologies can scan the outline every layer then perform a infill of multiple layers at once to speed up the process.

",Ryan Carlyle,"A few things are required for effective extrusion-style 3d printing materials:


It must stay where placed by the nozzle long enough to harden (or, alternately for pastes and such, have a shear-thinning or thixotropic viscous profile so it will not flow under its own weight). 
If using a filament extruder, it must have a wide range of viscosity that varies gradually over a considerable temperature range. This is necessary to develop the proper ""cap zone"" semi-melt shearing behavior that allows the incoming filament to act like a piston and generate pressure upstream of the nozzle. Pellet extruders have a similar requirement but related to screw/wall shearing rather than filament/wall shearing. If using neither filament nor pellets, such as clay printers, the material must be pumpable by a positive-displacement pump. (It is possible to pump molten metal, but the cost is quite high.)
It must form some kind of bond with previously-deposited solid material, without needing to be in a state that will rapidly flow and lose shape.
It must have some combination of low shrinkage, the ability to creep at the printer's ambient temp, and/or low stiffness that allows consecutive layers to be stacked without an unacceptable amount of warping. 


Liquid metals tend to have a conflict between ""Staying where you put it"" and ""bonding with the previous layer."" In order for deposited metal to fully bond, the interface material needs to reach the melting point so a true fusion weld occurs. And in order to supply enough heat to remelt the interface without an additional heat source like an arc, the deposited molten metal needs to be very hot. So it will tend to run while it cools. High density and high heat capacity makes it run fast and cool slowly. 

Pretty much every DIY metal 3d print (such as made by wire-feed MIG welders) ends up looking something like this:


https://3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage/

In comparison, polymers have long molecular chains that allow them to ""diffusion weld"" and adhere WITHOUT fully remelting the interface. Molten liquid plastic will stick to solid plastic quite effectively. The interface only needs to get hot enough for appreciable diffusion to intertwine the molecular chains. This will occur between the glass point and melting point, without true fusion occurring. So you can print molten plastic at a temperature where it will stay in place long enough to harden, and still get good bonding.

Metals also tend to be very stiff, which encourages warping. It is difficult to build a heated environment of sufficient temperature to properly stress-relieve the thermal contraction stress as the print progresses, whereas with plastic a heated build plate and warm enclosure can permit warping stresses to start relaxing as the print progresses. 

It is possible to ""FDM-style"" 3d print filament/wire made of metal alloys that have a wide range between solidus and liquidus. It has been done using solder and similar alloys. However, between the warping stresses, poor layer bonding from inadequate interface re-melting, and use of soft low-melting alloys, the resulting printed parts will usually end up being weaker than if they had simply been printed in a strong plastic. For example, PEEK is nearly as strong as aluminum, and carbon fiber or fiberglass composite plastics can exceed metals on various performance metrics. So what's the point of printing with weak, brittle metal alloys?

Over the years, lots of people have tried FDM-style metal printing, but no one has found it worthwhile to pursue in the long run. More typical DIY metal printing approaches like 3D MIG welding following by cleanup machining will produce better results.

",cmm,"I spent some time looking at making an FDM machine that would print bronze filament.  An alloy commonly made into wire had a difference between the solidus and liquidus temperature of only 50 degrees C.  I determined that one could make a conventional hot end, electrically heated, made of either molybdenum or tungsten.

I did not determine how the bronze would behave in the 50 degree solid-to-liquid zone.  I was more concerned about the solubility of the nozzle material in copper, for which I could find very little published data.

From my experience welding, and from printing plastics with FDM, there could be a problem with layer adhesion.  To really bond, the cooled material needs to be melted by the material being deposited in the next layer.  This is complicated by the temperature of the cooled material, the thermal conductivity of the material, and the propensity of the material to form oxides. These could be mitigated by heating the object in an inert atmosphere.

So, to answer the question, I would suggest looking at bronze alloys because they melt at moderate temperatures, and are less prone to oxidation than aluminum alloys.

",Tom van der Zanden,"There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air.

Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, this study that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.

It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its ""natural"" origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since ""natural"" materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.

That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against ""natural"" materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.

Another study is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).

There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).

Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a ""safer"" printers or using ""safer"" materials diminish.

Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.

",KobeJohn,"I am going to address the air issue as it is currently unresolved. the third dimension offers a great answer for common safety issues.

The short answer is that based on our limited knowledge at this point, there may be imperceptible health hazards related to FDM / FFF printers and therefore additional safety precautions are, in my opinion, necessary and not optional or secondary as suggested by some in the community.

In other words, if you can isolate your printer in a well-vented area where people rarely go, then of course it's not a health risk, but if people will be exposed to the air of the printer for any significant periods of time, you need to do something about it. This is my situation - where I live dedicated workshops and extra rooms are luxuries that most people do not have.



Realistic Chance of Being Dangerous --> Treat It As Dangerous

The key information at this point in time is the UFP (Ultra-Fine Particle) study that is linked in Tom's answer.

Leaving out the scary / detailed parts:


  Therefore, results herein suggest that caution should be used when
  operating these 3D printing instruments inside unvented or unfiltered
  indoor environments due to their large emissions of UFPs.
  
  One important limitation to this study is that we have no information
  about the chemical constituents of the UFPs emitted from either type
  of 3D printer [...]
  
  [...] there may also be
  differences in toxicity because of differences in chemical
  composition.


This means that although many processes release UFPs (the authors of the paper compare to cooking), all UFPs are not created equal. Since the UFPs from 3D printing are still an unknown, the only real answer from a safety perspective is to treat them as dangerous.



This is not legal, safety, or professional advice!

I am not qualified to give an opinion on what should be done but I will share what I would do:


Venting - Active airflow pushing the envelope of air around the print into a large, unpopulated body of air.
Enclosure + Venting - By fully enclosing your printer, it will probably keep the UFPs mostly within the enclosure. You could combine that with either continuous venting or as some have suggested purge venting before opening the enclosure.
Enclosure + Filtering - A filter can be applied both to the vent to reduce the output of UFPs (e.g. if you have no access to a safe body of air) and as a recirculating system that removes the UFPs from the body of air within the enclosure.


A note on positive vs negative pressure related to venting and filtering: if you produce positive pressure within the enclosure, you are going to be blowing all the UFPs out into your environment anyway. Negative pressure vented to a safe body of air or neutral pressure with good seals and recirculated filtering may avoid that.

A note on filters: Activated carbon filters will not remove UFPs. HEPA filters may remove 3D printing UFPs.



Which Printer?

As long as the uncertainty exists, I predict that as the market matures, filtering and enclosures will become more standard. At this point in time, the only enclosed AND HEPA filtered consumer-grade FDM printers I am aware of are the Up! Box and the Zortrax Inventure. There are a number of enclosed printers without filtering.

As an alternative, at least one company has appeared with products targeted at those who are concerned about various safety aspects of 3d printing.

",Jexoteric,"The standard option is to change out filaments at certain times during the print. Software to add these pauses to your print automatically are around, with one (ColorPrint). This method works if you only want to change at a certain Z height, and not intermix colors on the same levels.

The other newer development that works for many printers (this works for single nozzle printers as well) are getting Y type adapters that allow more than 1 filament to be fed into a single extruder, and use a rapid retraction to pull the filament back out past the Y connector to allow the next color to be fed into the nozzle. Several companies are putting products like this out on the market at this time. An example of this can be seen at this page.

As mentioned in other answers, Mosaic Pallette is an option to drive more complicated multi-color prints, but is a rather expensive option at $999.

Instead of printing the one part with support material, the piece can be split into two or more parts which can be printed without support material and assembled after the printing.

Here's a quote from the website (emphasize mine):


  PVA (Polyvinyl Acetate) filament prints translucent with a slightly yellow tint and is primarily used as a 3D printing support material because it is water-soluble, meaning that it will dissolve when exposed to water (and so MUST be kept dry prior to use). PVA is most often used with 3D printers capable of dual extrusion: one extruder printing a primary material (such as ABS or PLA) and the other printing this dissolvable filament to provide support for overhanging features.

",ζ--,"All three of these features are used to improve the quality and success rate of prints, especially those failing due to issues on the first few layers, or due to the small size of the first layer.

Raft

A raft is a horizontal feature made as the first few layers of a print, and is used to help with bed adhesion issues, primarily used with ABS. The first few layers printed are the brim (typically prismatic), with the part itself on top of it (with a small separation distance to aid in separation, to allow the part to be removed from the raft). This separation distance needs to be adjusted to allow the first layer of the actual part to adhere, but also for the raft to be removed easily.

Skirt

A skirt is a single-layer feature designed to help extruder priming and to establish a stable filament flow for an optimal first layer. They are generally a few passes around the first layer ""footprint"" in the rough shape of the first layer, but they do not touch the part itself or help adhesion directly (although having a primed and ready extruder helps extrusion on its own). 

Brim

A brim can be considered a skirt touching the first layer shape. It is used to help adhesion, and increases the first layer surface area (thus having more area to adhere to the bed). Brims are best used for parts with small first layers that fail to adhere properly. They are generally done as perimeters (as opposed to the crosshatching of infill) to be easily removable without damaging the part.

",Eric Johnson,"Rafts:

Rafts are a few layers of plastic a placed on the printing surface before the object is printed.  If non water dissoluble filament is used, a bit of an air gap will be placed between the raft and the print itself so it can be removed easily. A raft can help a print stick to the printing surface as it normally has a larger surface area than the bottom of the print.  It also allows the bottom layers of the print to contact another layer of plastic so there is less spreading compared to printing on the printing bed itself.



Skirts:

Skirts are loops of plastic that are extruded around the object that is being printed.  On the first layer this allows the filament to get pushed through the extruder so that a steady flow can be established.  A multiple layer skirt can be used to create a blockage around the print so there is less air movement on the print and the print can cool slower.



Brims:

A brim is a layer of plastic that is placed on the first layer of the print go allow for better adhesion to the printing surface.  It does not extend under the print as a raft does, but only goes from the edge of the print to a set distance away.

The process still takes a lot of human intervention, in the way of building the new printer and properly calibrating it.

Are there any practical methods of limiting such exposure? For example locking it in some special box, covering it or suck the odors? Would that help?

Do you have any experience doing so?
",Adam Davis,"Using negative pressure ventilation and a suitable organic filter will limit your exposure to toxic compounds, but won't completely remove them from your environment.

Enclose your printer in as air-tight a box as you can manage, then use a fan to suck air out of the box.  This negative pressure will ensure that any leaks in the box will not allow gasses to escape.

The air should be blown through an organic filter.  This might be done with face mask filters for painting, for instance.

Additional filtering may be done depending on the compounds you expect the printer to produce, but the ideal situation is to set up a ventilation system to the outdoors where the products cannot concentrate and harm anyone.

Another poorer option is to simply wear a proper organic filter mask yourself.  It's not as good, since the compounds can spread through your residence or remain in the air and be inhaled when you aren't printing.

",Tormod Haugene,"An option that might be feasible for some situations (depending on your setup) is Sequential Printing - a feature provided by some slicing software, for instance Slic3r.

In short, this allows you to print multiple objects one at a time rather than simultaneously. This has some obvious benefits, but also some downsides:

Benefits:


Each object is finished individually, and you will therefore not have multiple half-finished prints when something goes wrong. 
No particular printer or bed swapping mechanic is needed.


Downsides:


With most consumer printer, print area is somewhat limited, and sequential printing requires you to place objects so that the hot end can move freely between the finished objects, potentially restricting the effective usage of your print volume.
By printing objects one at a time, you limit the natural print cooling that happens when printing multiple objects at the same time. In particular for smaller prints, you might not want to print sequentially unless your print cooling solution is up for it.
Requires some setup


You specifically mention that you would like the finished prints to be moved outside the print area. In it self, sequential printing does not do this for you; however, if you fit your printer with a large, motorized print bed, you might achieve the same effect without moving into unfamiliar technology!

  A thicker layer height will provide more flow, and consequently more heat, making the extrusion adhere to the bed more.

It is recommended to raise the first layer height to match the diameter of the nozzle, e.g. a first layer height of 0.35mm for a 0.35mm nozzle.


In other words, larger layer heights for the first layer typically gives better adhesion, and makes inaccurate bed leveling (and auto leveling) still work.

",Kevin Morse,"Paraphrasing this site. Feel free to add suggestions in the form of comments and I will try to incorporate them.

Summary


ABS: Stronger, machinable, more flexible, and more temperature
resistant than PLA. Typically printed on a heated bed. Warping is a common problem when printing ABS.
PLA: Wider range of filaments available, easier and in some cases faster to print. Not as strong as ABS and the fact that its biodegradable could be seen as both a benefit and a drawback.


Material Properties:


ABS: Strong plastic with mild flexibility. Naturally beige in color. Can be filled and sanded. Higher temperature. Easy to recycle.
PLA: Not as strong as ABS but more rigid. Naturally transparent. More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures. Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities.


Part Accuracy:


ABS: Part warping is a significant issue. Sharp corners will often be rounded.
PLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.


Safety and Handling:


ABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS. Health concerns have been raised regarding airborne ultrafine particles generated while printing with ABS (ref). ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.
PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature. Moisture can also be absorbed into PLA and can irreversibly damage it.

PLA: gives off a smell similar to a semi-sweet cooking oil. Less intense smell than ABS. 


Part Accuracy: 

Both PLA and ABS are capable of building dimensionally accurate parts. However, there are characteristics that we need to memorized.
ABS: will be curling upwards of the surface in direct contact with the 3D printer’s print bed.  for fine and delicate features on parts involving sharp corners, such as gears, there will often be a slight rounding of the corner. 
PLA: much less part warping. but it undergoes more of a phase-change when heated and becomes much more liquid. The increased flow can also lead to stronger binding between layer.

Recycling:


ABS: Recycling number 7, most local recycling programs do not accept ABS. It generally being recycled into plastic lumber. 
PLA: it biodegrades, however the process takes a long time when outside of an industrial composting facility
Why we provide a vacuum sealed package for ABS and PLA products? 
long term exposure to a humid environment without sealed package may result in detrimental effects, both to the printing process and to the quality of finished parts. 

ABS: will tend to bubble and spurt from the tip of the nozzle when printing, part accuracy, strength are reduced. Raises the risk of clogging the nozzle. ABS can be easily dried by using dry or hot air.
PLA: bubbles or sporting at the nozzle, also discoloration and a reduction in 3D printed part are found when in long term moisture environment. 
Improving the printing outcomes （Blue tape and Kapton tape pictures)
PLA: printing temperature approximately: 190°C - 240°C
ABS: printing temperature approximately: 225°C - 250°C (recommend to use a heated print bed)

A good first layer adhesion is of the utmost importance in obtaining the best results for the prints. 

Using Blue Tape or Kapton Tape.
Hairspray the print bed.
To attain optimal result for the prints, you need to consider variables such as nozzel diameter, printing speed, and layer height.
Summary: 
ABS: 
A preferred filament for the prints with engineering and professional purposes with its strength, machinability, flexibility, and higher temperature resistance. 
The bad plastic smell is due to the petroleum based origin. 
Required a heated print bed to attain ABS printing reliability. 
PLA:
Wide range of available colors, provide translucencies and glossy feel of the prints. 
Plant based and semi-sweet corn like smelling are appreciated over ABS.
When properly cooled, PLA seems to perform higher maximum printing speeds, and sharper printed corners. Combining this with low warping on parts make it a popular plastic for household uses, toys, hobbyists, and educational purposes.

PLA has a reputation for being ""biodegradable"" and therefore it is often discouraged to use PLA outside and/or in contact with water. However, PLA only biodegrades under very specific conditions which it won't generally be exposed to so it can be used (though, as a harder and less flexible material it is more likely to be damaged by hail).

ABS and Nylon are good choices as well. Basically, any plastic you have on hand will last for years, even in an outside application.

",Adam Davis,"The biggest effect I've see on resolution is due to plastic stress due to thermal gradients.

The higher resolution prints build up more layers of material, and each layer has a cumulative effect on thermal stress.  The upper layers pulling up more as they cool, and the lower layers curling up more strongly as the layer count is increased.

To counteract this, a heated (or even just a draft free) enclosure makes a big difference.  Having a heated print bed helps significantly, as long as the bed itself resists deformation (a sheet metal or PCB bed will bend more than glass under the same tension, for instance).

The actual plastic strength, however, appears increased.  Laying down thinner layers of material appears to increase the bond strength between layers.

The layer height is typically set slightly smaller than the nozzle diameter, so the nozzle ""squeezes"" the new plastic onto the previous layer.

",walter,"It depends on a lot of factors, type of plastic, whether the parts need to be strong, can you use a vase print, etc.  Here's a few thoughts.

PLA - The brand of PLA makes a big difference, some can be printed very clear, some can't.  Most of the transparent PLAs I've used print much more clear at around 240°C.

ABS - I've seen some pretty impressive clear parts printed as a single layer shell in ABS and then vapor smoothed. I tend to find ABS more translucent and less transparent though.

PETG - Again the specific PETG you use matters, but I haven't seen nearly as much variation as with PLA.  I'm not sure how much temperature matters, but if it's too hot you get bubbles which will decrease clarity.

Thin Wall Prints - I don't have much experience here, but the Smooth On XTC-3D or vapor smoothing seem to be effective.

Solid Prints
If I want transparency, I usually print it at 100% infill (should be a real 100%, too much overextrusion or underextrusion will decrease transparency).  Printing slower and with less cooling sometimes helps.  It's easier to get the infill solid with a direct drive extruder, I couldn't get decent results with a long bowden tube (a short bowden tube works fine).

Here's a page where I tested 10 transparent filaments, the printed samples are 2mm thick, 100% infill - http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments.  Those samples are all overextruded a bit, you can get better results if you dial in the extrusion precisely, but that's hard to get right, and the optimal settings may change slightly depending on the part geometry.  Larger nozzles and thicker layers may help to, but I haven't experimented much with that as there are significant downsides to that approach.

How can I make 1.75&nbsp;mm from 3&nbsp;mm filament?
",Adam Davis,"In theory, making filament is easy.  You take a 3&nbsp;mm hotend with a 1.75&nbsp;mm hole, and extrude the 3&nbsp;mm (sometimes actually 2.85&nbsp;mm) filament, let it cool, and then reel it up.

In reality there are a lot of pitfalls to making filament - if the pressure isn't even, the hole not perfect, the temperature uneven, you can end up with oval filament, filament with bubbles, or worse.  If you are over temperature you may damage the filament and it could look good, but not melt correctly when used.  If you reel it too fast you may thin it out more than the intended diameter, or too slow and you may thicken it. A lot of hotends use steppers, which may result in ripples in the filament, so you may end up building a nearly custom filament machine.

Resolving all these problems is probably not worth simply selling or giving away the filament to someone that can use it, and buying the right size for your machine.

If you are still interested, though, you might as well go all the way and build a full filament extruder that accepts raw plastic feedstock (usually pellets) as well as your filament, and convert it that way, then continue using it to create your own filament.

There are some open designs for such machines you can build, or you could buy one, such as Filabot.

However, as mentioned by kaine, this is very unlikely to be worth the cost/effort. Best option for you is to try to sell the 3 mm filament to someone who has a use for it, take the money and buy some 1.75 mm filament instead.

It has been touted to have simular properties when printed to ABS and is especially useful for support structures (if the user has a multi-nozzle 3d Printer) as it is soluble in Limonene.

General Purpose PolyStyrene (GPPS) is frequently used in disposible cups, cutlery, etc.  I don't believe I have seen it as a 3D printing filament.  This is not styrofoam for the purpose of this question despite the identical chemical properties as the incorperated air makes it difficult to recycle.

Would filament produced from GPPS, be usable on most FFF 3D printers that are capable of using ABS, PLA, and HIPS? Are that any particular issues observed with such filaments that would not be observed with HIPS (besides the implied decrease in impact resistance)?

Note: For the purpose of this question, I am assuming that the filament can be produced and am concerned about whether the filament would be usable for support structures and infill.
",Ryan Carlyle,"In principle, it should work fine as a filament, since it's used extensively in the plastic extrusion industry, but I don't think you'd get great material properties out of it. ABS and HIPS incorporate polybutadiene into a graft polymer structure for a very good reason: the butadiene sections in the long molecular chains kind of ""stick together"" as a distinct solid phase to produce what amounts to micro-bubbles of rubber inside a matrix of hard styrene or acrylonitrile-styrene plastic. This compound microstructure is what gives HIPS and ABS favorable impact toughness and some minor flexibility.

The flexibility is important -- the stiffer a filament is, the more it will tend to warp while printing. Based on chemistry alone, I would expect styrene to be somewhat more prone to warping than ABS. And it would certainly be more brittle. So there doesn't seem to be much reason to use it as filament.

Interesting sidenote: PLA/PHA has very favorable mechanical properties because the PHA forms a very similar flexible microstructure inside the hard PLA matrix. PLA/PHA is good stuff because it mimics ABS and HIPS!

It prints really well, just tricky to get it to stick to the bed (I'm still working on that), but otherwise it's great.

Once printed, the main difference from PLA prints is the nylon remains more flexible.  If you bend a thin nylon print, it tends to just spring back to the shape that came off the printer.  That's very different from my PLA prints, which will either stay bent or break apart.

I believe that nylon would be a good material for you to try for stamps, because of this flexibility and shape-preserving quality.  The comments show some other materials to try, but I'm limiting my answer here to my own personal experience.

",Chris Thompson,"I see three options...

1. Print with a flexible filament:


Many options: TPU as you pointed out, the flexible PLA that Tom mentioned, and others.  Here's an article with a few options from Matter Hackers
I'd suggest printing the stamp side down so you get a nice flat stamp with no post processing.  For any wide gaps, mind your bridging...use fillets or chamfers so the ""roof"" of the gap is an upside down V or U shape.


2. Print with any hard filament, but use a rubber mat under the paper.


The idea here is to use a semi-flexible surface under the paper to help get uniform contact pressure between the paper and the hard stamp.  As long as your stamp holds ink, this should work okay.


3. Print your stamp shape, then use it to make a rubber stamp.


Making a model and then copying it with your desired non-printable material is a common manufacturing technique that can be used in many situations.  Use of molds for casting and related processes can really expand your possibilities.  Check out Smooth On.  They have several rubber and flexible compounds that you could use for stamps.

",Chris Thompson,"You're on the right track.  Since you asked for ""steps"" here you go:

Step 1. Choose a safe material: 

Consider chemical safety and physical safety. Food grade PLA should be chemically safe, but could be too brittle depending on the design you choose.  PETG, T-Glase, or similar filaments (depending on dye) are normally also chemically safe and are less brittle than PLA so may be a better alternative.  ABS is NOT typically considered safe for food contact.

Step 2. Choose a safe design: 

If using PLA, be sure the design is robust enough to ensure it won't break.  Broken rattles with sharp edges make baby...sad.  Even less brittle filaments can still break with jagged edges if the design is fragile.

Step 2a. Choose a single piece design:  

Choose a design that requires you to add the peas (or other safe filler) during the print such that the finished rattle is fully enclosed.  This will minimize parts becoming loose or peas spilling and minimize choke hazards.

Step 3. Consider post processing to improve safety:

Sanding could reduce ridges and minimize crevices that could harbor bacteria, but sealing it with a food-safe sealant may be more effective.  There are many sealants that the FDA considers safe, but polyurethane or food-safe epoxy finishes will work well with PLA. (If you use a different material, test to verify good adhesion.)

Step 4. Test:

Make a test rattle and run it through the paces.  I guess you could chew on it, but since babies don't have teeth, this might invalidate your data...

Step 5. Consider alternatives such as professional printing services:

If your tests don't inspire confidence, professional services can offer additional materials (metals, ceramics, etc.) that could be safer than a typical fused filament printer.
